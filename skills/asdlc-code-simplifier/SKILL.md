# Code Simplifier

## Overview

Improve code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality. Prioritize readable, explicit code over overly compact solutions.

## Usage

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing recently modified code for simplification opportunities
- Refactoring code for improved readability
- Applying project coding standards consistently
- Reducing unnecessary complexity and nesting
- Consolidating redundant code or abstractions

## Core Concepts

### Preserve Functionality

Never change what the code does, only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors **MUST** remain intact.

### Clarity Over Brevity

- Avoid nested ternary operators: prefer switch statements or if/else chains
- Explicit code is better than overly compact code
- Readable code beats clever one-liners

### Balance

Avoid over-simplification that could reduce maintainability, create overly clever solutions, combine too many concerns, or remove helpful abstractions.

## Refinement Process

1. **Identify** recently modified code sections
2. **Analyze** for clarity and consistency improvements
3. **Apply** project-specific best practices
4. **Verify** functionality remains unchanged
5. **Document** only significant changes

## Quick Reference

| Improvement  | Do                       | Don't                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Conditionals | Use if/else or switch    | Nested ternaries            |
| Naming       | Clear, descriptive names | Abbreviations               |
| Nesting      | Flatten when possible    | Deep nesting (>3)           |
| Comments     | Explain why, not what    | Obvious comments            |
| Abstractions | Keep helpful ones        | Remove all for "simplicity" |

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Simplification

**Problem:** Combining too much into dense one-liners for fewer lines.
**Fix:** Prioritize readability over line count.

### Changing Behavior

**Problem:** Accidentally altering functionality while refactoring.
**Fix:** Test before and after. Preserve all outputs and behaviors.

### Removing Useful Abstractions

**Problem:** Flattening everything removes helpful organization.
**Fix:** Keep abstractions that improve code organization and reuse.
