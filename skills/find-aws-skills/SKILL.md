# Find AWS Skills

## Workflow

### Step 1: Search for skills

Use `aws___search_documentation` with the translated search phrase as `search_phrase`,
`topics=["agent_skills"]`, and `limit=3`.

Translate the user's intent into a somewhat verbose search phrase that preserves context. This
improves vector search relevance over minimal keywords.

| User says                                   | Search phrase                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "Create a production VPC with multiple AZs" | `create production VPC multi-AZ networking`         |
| "My Lambda is timing out"                   | `Lambda function timeout debugging troubleshooting` |
| "Lock down my S3 buckets"                   | `secure S3 bucket access policy hardening`          |
| "Deploy my app to AWS"                      | `deploy application AWS infrastructure`             |
| "I'm getting access denied on S3"           | `S3 access denied error troubleshooting`            |

New skills are added regularly. Do not assume a skill does not exist without searching first.

### Step 2: Pick and load a skill

Read the returned results' descriptions and scores. Results are ordered by relevance. The first
result is the strongest match. Pick the most relevant one based on this ordering and the user's
context.

Use `aws___retrieve_skill` with the exact `skill_name` from the selected result. Skill names are
opaque identifiers. Do not guess or fabricate them.

Follow the loaded skill's instructions. If the skill references additional files (e.g.,
`references/architecture.md`), retrieve them by calling `aws___retrieve_skill` again with the same
`skill_name` and the `file` parameter set to the referenced path.

If none of the returned results are relevant to the user's request, treat it the same as no results
and proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Handle failures

If the search returns no results, no result is relevant, or skill retrieval fails for any reason,
give the user a friendly message explaining what happened and offer options:

1. Retry with a different search phrase
2. Proceed with direct AWS CLI commands (`aws___suggest_aws_commands`)
3. Let the user guide you on how they'd like to proceed

Do not silently fall back to CLI tools. Always wait for the user's confirmation first.
