# Infrastructure Validation

## Overview

Reviews CDK and CloudFormation code for security vulnerabilities, cost optimization opportunities, compliance gaps, and operational readiness issues. Covers IAM, encryption, logging, backup, and Well-Architected Framework alignment.

## Usage

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing CDK or CloudFormation before deployment
- Checking infrastructure for security and compliance issues
- Validating Well-Architected Framework alignment

## Core Concepts

### Well-Architected Alignment

Reviews against AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars: security (encryption, IAM, network), reliability (multi-AZ, backups, deletion protection), performance (right-sizing, caching), cost optimization (tagging, reserved capacity), and operational excellence (monitoring, logging, alarms).

## Execution

When this skill is activated, use the following as your full instruction set for validating infrastructure code. Apply the Quality Gate at the end before presenting output to the user.

### MANDATORY FIRST STEP - READ THIS

**YOU MUST STOP AND ASK FOR INFORMATION BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE**

Before you read any files, search any directories, or analyze any code, you MUST:

1. **CHECK**: Has the user provided Infrastructure Type, Folder Path, and Environment?
2. **IF NO**: Stop immediately and ask using the template from the "CRITICAL: STOP AND READ THIS FIRST" section above

## Validation Process

**⛔ STOP: You cannot proceed to Step 1 without completing Step 0 ⛔**

### Step 0: Gather Requirements (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**This step is NOT optional. You MUST complete this before any analysis.**

**Before any validation work begins:**

1. Verify you have received the required information:
   - Infrastructure Type
   - Folder Path or pasted code
   - Environment (dev/staging/production)

2. If missing, ask the user using the format from "CRITICAL: Start Here" section

3. Clarify any optional details that would improve validation quality:
   - Compliance requirements
   - Validation focus areas
   - Known issues or concerns

**DO NOT proceed to Step 1 until you have this information.**

### Step 1: Initial Analysis and Resource Discovery

#### 1.1 Identify Infrastructure Type

Determine format:

- CDK TypeScript (`.ts` files with `aws-cdk-lib` imports)
- CDK Python (`.py` files with `aws_cdk` imports)
- CloudFormation JSON (`.json` with `"Resources"` key)
- CloudFormation YAML (`.yaml`/`.yml` with `Resources:` key)

#### 1.2 Create Complete Resource Inventory

**For CloudFormation Templates**:

Use systematic discovery to find ALL resources:

```bash
# List all resource types and counts
jq '.Resources | to_entries | group_by(.value.Type) | map({type: .[0].value.Type, count: length})' template.json

# Extract specific resource types for detailed analysis
jq '.Resources | to_entries[] | select(.value.Type == "AWS::IAM::Policy") | .key' template.json
jq '.Resources | to_entries[] | select(.value.Type == "AWS::Lambda::Function") | .key' template.json
jq '.Resources | to_entries[] | select(.value.Type == "AWS::DynamoDB::Table") | .key' template.json
jq '.Resources | to_entries[] | select(.value.Type == "AWS::S3::Bucket") | .key' template.json
```

**For CDK Source Code**:

Search for construct instantiations:

- `new lambda.Function(`
- `new dynamodb.Table(`
- `new s3.Bucket(`
- `new apigateway.RestApi(`

#### 1.3 Understand Architecture

- [ ] No hardcoded account IDs or regions (use pseudo-parameters)

### Step 6: Systematic Resource Inventory

**BEFORE generating report, create complete resource inventory**

#### 6.1 Count and List All Resources by Type

Create inventory showing:

```
Resource Type                    | Count | Critical Checks Completed
--------------------------------|-------|-------------------------

## Example Review Output

````markdown
## Infrastructure Code Review: TaskFlow Serverless Stack

### Overall Assessment

**Status**: NEEDS REVISION
**Confidence Level**: HIGH
**Critical Issues**: 3
**High Priority Issues**: 5
**Medium Priority Issues**: 8
**Low Priority Issues**: 2

### Critical Issues

**Security** - S3 Bucket (DocumentsBucket)
Issue: S3 bucket does not have encryption at rest enabled
Impact: Sensitive data stored unencrypted violates security best practices and compliance requirements
Fix: Enable server-side encryption with AWS managed keys or customer managed KMS keys
Example:

```typescript
// Before
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'DocumentsBucket', {
  bucketName: 'taskflow-documents',
  versioned: true,
});

// After
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'DocumentsBucket', {
  bucketName: 'taskflow-documents',
  versioned: true,
  encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
  // Or for customer managed keys:
  // encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.KMS,
  // encryptionKey: new kms.Key(this, 'BucketKey')
});
```

**Security** - Lambda Function (TaskProcessorFunction)
Issue: Lambda function has wildcard IAM permissions (Action: "_", Resource: "_")
Impact: Violates least privilege principle, excessive permissions increase security risk
Fix: Grant specific permissions only for required operations
Example:

```typescript
// Before
taskFunction.addToRolePolicy(
  new iam.PolicyStatement({
    actions: ['*'],
    resources: ['*'],
  }),
);

// After
taskFunction.addToRolePolicy(
  new iam.PolicyStatement({
    actions: ['dynamodb:GetItem', 'dynamodb:PutItem', 'dynamodb:UpdateItem', 'dynamodb:Query'],
    resources: [taskTable.tableArn, `${taskTable.tableArn}/index/*`],
  }),
);
```

**Security** - DynamoDB Table (TasksTable)
Issue: DynamoDB table does not have encryption at rest enabled
Impact: Sensitive task data stored unencrypted violates compliance requirements
Fix: Enable encryption using AWS managed keys or customer managed KMS keys
Example:

```typescript
// Before
const table = new dynamodb.Table(this, 'TasksTable', {
  partitionKey: { name: 'taskId', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING },
  billingMode: dynamodb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
});

// After
const table = new dynamodb.Table(this, 'TasksTable', {
  partitionKey: { name: 'taskId', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING },
  billingMode: dynamodb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
  encryption: dynamodb.TableEncryption.AWS_MANAGED,
  // Or for customer managed keys:
  // encryption: dynamodb.TableEncryption.CUSTOMER_MANAGED,
  // encryptionKey: new kms.Key(this, 'TableKey')
});
```

### High Priority Issues

**Operational Excellence** - Lambda Function (TaskProcessorFunction)
Issue: No CloudWatch alarms configured for Lambda errors or throttling
Impact: Production issues may go undetected, delayed incident response
Recommendation: Configure alarms for errors, throttling, and duration
Example:

```typescript
// Add error alarm
const errorAlarm = new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'TaskProcessorErrors', {
  metric: taskFunction.metricErrors(),
  threshold: 5,
  evaluationPeriods: 2,
  treatMissingData: cloudwatch.TreatMissingData.NOT_BREACHING,
  alarmDescription: 'Alert when Lambda function has errors',
});

// Add throttling alarm
const throttleAlarm = new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'TaskProcessorThrottles', {
  metric: taskFunction.metricThrottles(),
  threshold: 1,
  evaluationPeriods: 1,
  alarmDescription: 'Alert when Lambda function is throttled',
});

// Add duration alarm
const durationAlarm = new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'TaskProcessorDuration', {
  metric: taskFunction.metricDuration(),
  threshold: 5000, // 5 seconds
  evaluationPeriods: 3,
  alarmDescription: 'Alert when Lambda duration exceeds threshold',
});
```

**Operational Excellence** - DynamoDB Table (TasksTable)
Issue: Point-in-time recovery not enabled for production table
Impact: Cannot recover from accidental data deletion or corruption
Recommendation: Enable PITR for production tables
Example:

```typescript
const table = new dynamodb.Table(this, 'TasksTable', {
  partitionKey: { name: 'taskId', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING },
  billingMode: dynamodb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
  encryption: dynamodb.TableEncryption.AWS_MANAGED,
  pointInTimeRecovery: true, // Enable PITR
});
```

**Operational Excellence** - Lambda Function (TaskProcessorFunction)
Issue: No dead letter queue configured for failed invocations
Impact: Failed invocations lost, no visibility into failures
Recommendation: Configure DLQ for error handling and debugging
Example:

```typescript
const dlq = new sqs.Queue(this, 'TaskProcessorDLQ', {
  queueName: 'task-processor-dlq',
  retentionPeriod: cdk.Duration.days(14),
});

const taskFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'TaskProcessorFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
  deadLetterQueue: dlq,
  deadLetterQueueEnabled: true,
});
```

### Medium Priority Issues

**Cost Optimization** - Lambda Function (TaskProcessorFunction)
Observation: Lambda function using default memory (128MB) without analysis
Benefit: Right-sizing memory can improve performance and reduce cost
Alternative: Analyze actual memory usage and adjust accordingly
Example:

```typescript
// Analyze CloudWatch metrics for actual memory usage
// Then adjust memory allocation
const taskFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'TaskProcessorFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
  memorySize: 512, // Adjust based on actual usage
  timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(30), // Also review timeout
});
```

**Performance** - Lambda Function (TaskProcessorFunction)
Observation: Lambda function not using ARM64 architecture (Graviton)
Benefit: 20% better price performance with Graviton processors
Alternative: Switch to ARM64 architecture for cost and performance benefits
Example:

```typescript
const taskFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'TaskProcessorFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
  architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64, // Use Graviton
});
```

**Cost Optimization** - S3 Bucket (DocumentsBucket)
Observation: No lifecycle policy configured for infrequent access data
Benefit: Potential 50-80% storage cost savings for infrequently accessed data
Alternative: Configure lifecycle policy to transition to Intelligent-Tiering or Glacier
Example:

```typescript
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'DocumentsBucket', {
  bucketName: 'taskflow-documents',
  versioned: true,
  encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
  lifecycleRules: [
    {
      id: 'TransitionToIntelligentTiering',
      enabled: true,
      transitions: [
        {
          storageClass: s3.StorageClass.INTELLIGENT_TIERING,
          transitionAfter: cdk.Duration.days(30),
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 'TransitionToGlacier',
      enabled: true,
      transitions: [
        {
          storageClass: s3.StorageClass.GLACIER,
          transitionAfter: cdk.Duration.days(90),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Low Priority Issues

**Code Quality** - Stack Organization
Suggestion: Consider extracting repeated patterns into reusable constructs
Benefit: Improved code maintainability and reusability

**Documentation** - Missing inline comments
Suggestion: Add inline comments explaining complex resource configurations
Benefit: Improved code readability for team members

### Positive Findings

**Security**
Good practice: API Gateway has authentication configured with Cognito User Pool

**Reliability**
Good practice: DynamoDB table using on-demand billing mode for unpredictable traffic

**Code Organization**
Good practice: Consistent naming conventions across resources

**Operational Excellence**
Good practice: CloudWatch Logs retention configured (not indefinite)

## Validation Summary

**Overall Recommendation**: Address 3 critical security issues before deployment. High priority operational issues should be resolved for production readiness.

**Key Strengths**:

- Good authentication configuration
- Appropriate billing mode for DynamoDB
- Consistent naming conventions

**Critical Gaps**:

- Missing encryption at rest for S3 and DynamoDB
- Overly permissive IAM policies
- Missing operational monitoring

**Estimated Cost Savings**: $150-200/month from lifecycle policies and Lambda optimization

**Timeline Impact**: 2-3 days to address critical and high priority issues

## Quality Gate

**CRITICAL (must fix):**

- S3 buckets with public access enabled
- Encryption at rest not configured for data stores
- Security groups with `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on non-HTTP ports
- No deletion protection on stateful resources (RDS, DynamoDB)

**IMPORTANT (should fix):**

- CloudWatch alarms not defined for key metrics
- No backup configuration for stateful resources
- Lambda functions without reserved concurrency limits

**SUGGESTION:**

- Could enable VPC Flow Logs for network visibility
- Could add cost allocation tags to all resources

Present findings as: CRITICAL → IMPORTANT → SUGGESTION. Ask: "Fix these issues? [y/n]", unless `scope_confirmed` is true, in which case report all the findings and leave fixing to the caller, without asking.
