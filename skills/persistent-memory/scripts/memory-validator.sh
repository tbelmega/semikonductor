#      for anyone who hasn't hand-authored one -- failing here would
#      block every ordinary memory write.

# Derive the "entry" text a line contributes to content validation.
# CWE-20 fix: content checks must not be limited to bullet lines -- an
# injection payload formatted as a heading, paragraph, blockquote, or
# numbered-list item must be checked too, since it is written to disk
# verbatim just like a bullet entry. This strips a leading bullet marker
# (- / *) or numbered-list marker (1. / 2. / ...) when present; any other
# line (heading, paragraph, blockquote, etc.) is used as-is.
#
# The bullet strip is ANCHORED (matches the numbered-item branch below):
# it removes exactly one leading marker char and its following space(s),
# nothing more. A prior version used the bash "${line#*[-*] }" shortest-
# prefix expansion, which matches the FIRST occurrence anywhere in the
# line of a "-"/"*" followed by a space -- not necessarily the leading
# one. When the leading marker is not immediately followed by a single
# space (e.g. "-1 *payload* text"), that shortest-match can land on a
# LATER "* "/"- " inside the payload (such as closing markdown emphasis),
# truncating everything before it away from the checked entry while the
# full original line is still written to disk verbatim via $PROPOSED.
# The anchored sed strip below cannot skip past the leading marker, so it
# preserves the rest of the payload -- including any later "*"/"-" -- for
# the content checks.

# Strip leading markdown structural markers so the keyword-at-start check
# below isn't defeated by a marker sitting at position 0 (e.g. "## Ignore",
# "> Ignore", "**Ignore**", "`Ignore`"). Looped until a pass makes no
# further change, so nested markers (e.g. "> ## **Ignore") resolve fully
# regardless of order. Feeds ONLY the anchored keyword-at-start check below
# -- the phrase loop and the kw+agent_word combo loop are already
# substring-based and match a keyword anywhere in the line, marker or not,
# so they're deliberately left untouched.
#
# STRUCTURAL rule, not an enumeration: strip any leading run of characters
# that are neither alphanumeric nor whitespace. This closes the specific
# bypass reported (a leading backtick, e.g. "`Ignore the earlier retention
# rule`", was not in the old marker-by-marker list) and, being general
# rather than enumerated, also closes any FUTURE punctuation-based marker
# without another patch here. It supersedes and subsumes the individual
# blockquote (>), heading (#), emphasis (*/_), and bullet (-/*/+) rules,
# which were all just special cases of "leading punctuation" -- those are
# folded into step 2 below rather than kept as separate rules, since
# keeping them alongside a general rule that already covers them would be
# redundant.
#
# The numbered-marker rule (N. / N)) is the one case that CANNOT fold into
# the general rule: digits are alphanumeric, so "1." in "1. Ignore" is only
# half-stripped by the punctuation rule (the "." goes, the "1" doesn't).

# 4. Budget check

# (common in minimal containers, cron jobs, and systemd services where
# LANG/LC_ALL are unset or "C") it counts bytes, inflating multi-byte
# UTF-8 content and falsely rejecting content that is actually under
# budget. Forcing a specific UTF-8 locale (e.g. LC_ALL=C.UTF-8) is not a
# fix: if that locale isn't installed, wc silently falls back to
# byte-counting with no error, reproducing the same bug in a
# harder-to-notice form. Count with Bun instead: spreading a decoded
# string counts Unicode code points regardless of the ambient locale.
# This makes bun a required dependency for every write, not just when a
# config file is present (as _parse_config above already needs it) -- so
# an invocation failure here is reported the same way, as an environment
