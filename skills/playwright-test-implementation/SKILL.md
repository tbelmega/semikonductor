# Playwright Test Implementation

## Overview

Covers the parts of writing a Playwright spec that are easy to get wrong: which locator to reach for first, how to sign in once and reuse that session across every spec, and how to handle Cloudscape's non-standard ARIA patterns. This is authoring guidance, not a project scaffolder. It assumes a Playwright project already exists (see Prerequisites) and a set of pages/selectors already discovered from the target app.

## Usage

Use this skill when:

- Writing Playwright spec files against a discovered web app
- Setting up `global-setup.ts` and `storageState` for authenticated flows
- Choosing selectors for a page, or debugging a flaky/ambiguous one
- Writing specs against a Cloudscape UI, where standard ARIA-based locators often don't apply
- Reviewing an existing Playwright spec for selector fragility or missing session handling

Do NOT use for: scaffolding a new Playwright project from scratch, planning which tests to write (see `e2e-test-strategy`), or Cypress specs (see `cypress-test-implementation`).

## Prerequisites

### Playwright is a prerequisite, not something this skill installs

This skill assumes Playwright is already part of the project. It does not install Playwright, run installers, or shell out to set it up automatically. Installation is the customer's own step, done once per project.

**Check first, before assuming it's missing:**

```bash
npx --no-install playwright --version
```

If that resolves, Playwright is already installed in this project. Move on to authoring. `--no-install` is required: a bare `npx playwright --version` silently fetches `@playwright/test` from the registry when it's absent (in a non-interactive shell it installs without prompting), so the check passes against a project that can't actually run a spec. The auto-fetch is itself the exact behavior the CRITICAL gate at the bottom of this file forbids the skill from triggering. Also check `package.json` for `@playwright/test` under `dependencies` or `devDependencies` as a second signal.

**If it's missing, tell the customer how to add it, do not install it on their behalf:**

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install          # downloads the browser binaries Playwright drives
```

`npx playwright install` is a separate step from the npm install. It fetches the actual browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), and specs will fail at launch time without it even if `@playwright/test` is present in `node_modules`.

If a project needs only one browser, `npx playwright install chromium` is enough and considerably faster in CI.

## Steps

### Step 1: Confirm the project can run a spec at all

_Applies when adding specs to an existing Playwright project. Skip on a fresh/bootstrap project where no specs exist yet. `playwright test --list` exits non-zero with "no tests found" in that state, which is expected, not a setup problem._

Before writing any spec content, run `npx playwright test --list` in the project root. An error here means something in the project setup, not the spec you're about to write, needs fixing first (see Prerequisites, or `tsconfig.json` if it's a compilation error). The `--list` check that actually matters on a fresh project is the one run _after_ specs are written (Verification section, and the SOP's Step 5). That's the point at which a failure means something real.

### Step 2: Set up the authenticated session (`global-setup.ts` + `storageState`)

For any app that requires sign-in, sign in once in a global setup script and reuse that session across every spec. Don't re-authenticate per test.

```typescript
import { chromium } from '@playwright/test';

export default async function globalSetup() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();
  await page.goto(process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL!);
  await page
    .locator('input[name="username"]:visible')
    .fill(process.env.TEST_USERNAME!);
  await page
    .locator('input[name="password"]:visible')
    .fill(process.env.TEST_PASSWORD!);
  await page.locator('button[type="submit"]:visible').click();
  await page.waitForURL(/\/dashboard/);
  await context.storageState({ path: 'fixtures/auth/state.json' });
  await browser.close();
}
```

The three selectors above are placeholders. Replace them with the actual selectors for the login page. Don't ship the generic version. The `waitForURL(/\/dashboard/)` line is a placeholder too: it must point at the app's real post-login destination, not this literal pattern.

Then wire it into `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  globalSetup: './global-setup',
  use: {
    storageState: 'fixtures/auth/state.json',
    baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL,
  },
});
```

Playwright does not auto-read `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`. The `baseURL` line above has to be there explicitly, or every `page.goto()` call needs a full URL.

Before any of this runs, create the directory `storageState` writes into:

```bash
mkdir -p fixtures/auth
```

`context.storageState()` throws `ENOENT` if `fixtures/auth/` doesn't exist yet. Playwright will not create it for you. Add `fixtures/auth/` to `.gitignore` too; it holds live session tokens and must never be committed.

**Two details that are easy to get wrong here:**

- **Wait for the redirect to actually finish before saving state.** Wait on a concrete post-login signal before `context.storageState()`, either a URL pattern that only matches the real post-login destination (`page.waitForURL(/\/dashboard/)`) or a visible element that only exists once authenticated (`await expect(page.getByTestId('user-menu')).toBeVisible()`). Matching the exact base URL as the wait pattern fails whenever sign-in redirects to a different path (OAuth, SSO), but the two fixes below are both worse than they look: `'**'` matches essentially any URL, including the pre-redirect one, so the wait can resolve before the auth redirect has settled and save an unauthenticated state; and Playwright's own docs discourage `waitUntil: 'networkidle'` for waiting on navigation because it is flaky. Use a signal specific to the target app instead. Replace the placeholder above with the app's real post-login URL or element.
- **Hosted SSO pages often render a hidden duplicate form.** If the login page is a hosted UI (Cognito, Okta, etc.), scope selectors with `:visible`, e.g. `page.locator('input[name="username"]:visible')`, or Playwright can time out matching two elements with the same selector, one of them hidden.

Read credentials from `process.env.TEST_USERNAME` / `process.env.TEST_PASSWORD` in both the setup script and specs, never hardcode them.

### Step 3: Pick selectors using this fallback chain, in order

Stop at the first one that applies:

1. `page.getByTestId('...')`, preferred; needs a `data-testid` attribute on the element
2. `page.getByRole('...', { name: /.../ })`, scoped to a container. Always scope it, or a role query can match the same role/name pair on a different part of the page: `page.locator('[data-testid="table"]').getByRole('button', { name: /delete/i })`
3. `page.getByLabel('...')`, for form inputs with an associated label
4. `page.getByPlaceholder('...')`, for inputs that have no label
5. `page.locator('[aria-label="..."]')`, for elements with an `aria-label` but no visible text

If none of these resolve cleanly and you reach for `.first()`, add a comment explaining why the selector is ambiguous and why the first match is the right one. An unexplained `.first()` is a sign the selector needs to be scoped tighter, not accepted as-is.

### Step 4: Apply Cloudscape-specific patterns where the app uses Cloudscape

Cloudscape components deviate from standard ARIA semantics in ways that break the fallback chain above. Use these instead:

- **Table row selection:** `row.locator('input[type="radio"]').click({ force: true })`, not `row.click()`. Cloudscape table rows use radio inputs that need `force: true` to click through the overlay.
- **Tiles / radio groups:** `page.locator('label').filter({ hasText: /label text/ }).locator('input[type="radio"]').click({ force: true })`. Tiles render unlabeled radio inputs, so `getByRole('radio', { name })` never matches; `input[type="radio"]` is a void element with no text content, so `.filter({ hasText })` has to be applied to the wrapping `label`, not the input itself.
- **Select / dropdown:** two steps, open with `getByRole('button', { name: /select .*/i })`, then pick with `page.getByRole('listbox').getByRole('option', { name: /value/i })`. Scope the option pick to the open listbox container, or it can match a stale option list left over from another dropdown elsewhere on the page.
- **Modals with more than one close control:** scope to the footer, `page.locator('[role="dialog"]').locator('footer, [class*="footer"]').getByRole('button', { name: /cancel/i })`. Modals typically have both an X button and a footer Cancel button; an unscoped query can match either.
- **Form fields:** prefer `getByPlaceholder()` over `getByLabel()`. Cloudscape form fields don't always wire up standard label associations.

### Step 5: Opt out of the global session for login-flow specs

A spec that tests the login page itself, or authentication behavior in general, has to opt out of the global `storageState`. Otherwise Playwright starts the test already signed in and skips the page under test entirely.

```typescript
test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } });
```

Place this at the top of the spec file. `test.use({ storageState: undefined })` does not work here. `undefined` falls through to the project-level config instead of clearing it, so the explicit empty object is required.

An alternative to opting out per-spec: define a separate Playwright project in `playwright.config.ts` with no `storageState`, and put all auth-flow specs there.

## Pitfalls

- **`ENOENT` from `context.storageState()`.** `fixtures/auth/` doesn't exist. Run `mkdir -p fixtures/auth` before global setup runs.
- **`baseURL` silently not applied.** `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` isn't picked up automatically; `use: { baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL }` has to be written explicitly in `playwright.config.ts`.
- **Global setup saves state before the redirect finishes.** Waiting on the literal base URL breaks the moment sign-in redirects anywhere else (OAuth, SSO), but `'**'` alone is not the fix. It matches the pre-redirect URL too, with or without `waitUntil: 'networkidle'`, and `networkidle` is separately discouraged by Playwright's own docs for waiting on navigation. Wait on a concrete post-login URL pattern or a visible authenticated-page element instead.
- **Login-flow specs never reach the login page.** The global `storageState` signs the test in before it starts. Opt out with an explicit empty `storageState` object, not `undefined`.
- **Ambiguous-selector timeouts on hosted SSO pages.** A hidden duplicate form matches the same selector as the visible one. Scope with `:visible`.
- **`getByRole('radio', { name })` never matches Cloudscape tiles.** The radio input itself carries no text; filter the wrapping `label` by text instead.
- **Credentials leaking into a generated spec.** `process.env.TEST_USERNAME` / `TEST_PASSWORD` belong in the environment, never hardcoded in a spec or committed alongside `fixtures/auth/state.json`.

## Verification

- `npx playwright test --list` runs clean and lists every spec. A compile or config error here means the setup is broken, not the individual specs.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
- For any spec touching authentication: delete `fixtures/auth/state.json`, run the suite once to confirm global setup regenerates it, then run again to confirm the second run reuses the saved session instead of re-authenticating.
- For any login-flow spec: confirm it actually renders the login page (not a post-login page) by asserting on a login-page element before interacting with it.
- Grep the generated spec files and `fixtures/` for the literal test password before committing anything. It should never appear outside the environment.

## Quality Gate

**CRITICAL (must fix):**

- Hardcoded credentials in any spec file or in `global-setup.ts`
- `fixtures/auth/` (or wherever `storageState` writes to) not in `.gitignore`
- A login-flow spec does not opt out of the global `storageState`
- Playwright installation attempted or scripted by this skill's own procedure instead of directed to the customer

**IMPORTANT (should fix):**

- A selector could have used `getByTestId()` or `getByRole()` but falls back to a raw CSS locator instead
- `.first()` used without an inline justification comment
- `waitForURL()` matches the literal base URL or uses the wildcard `'**'` (with or without `waitUntil: 'networkidle'`), instead of a concrete post-login signal in a global setup that goes through a redirect
- Cloudscape UI targeted with standard ARIA locators instead of the scoped patterns above

**SUGGESTION:**

- Could split auth-flow specs into their own Playwright `project` instead of opting out of `storageState` per file
- Could add a comment linking a Cloudscape-specific locator back to the exact deviation it's working around

Present findings as: CRITICAL → IMPORTANT → SUGGESTION. Ask: "Fix these issues? [y/n]"
