# Design Doc Creation

## Overview

This SOP guides the architect through a five-phase workflow to produce a design document ready for principal engineer review from user stories or a problem statement. It applies Socratic requirements elicitation, outside-in structure enforcement, automated quality gates, and an adversarial review loop before presenting the final artifact.

Invoked when the engineer asks to create or write a design document (e.g., "Design a system for X", "I need a design doc for Y"). For reviewing an _existing_ document, use `k-existing-design-review.sop.md` instead.

## Parameters

- **topic** (required): The system, feature, or problem to design. Accepts a free-form description, user stories, or a problem statement.
- **output_path** (optional, default: `docs/design/<slugified-topic>.md`): Path to write the design doc.
- **validation_output_dir** (optional, default: `docs/design/`): Directory for Phase 3's AWS-validation and trade-off reports. Its default reproduces today's hardcoded location exactly, so a caller that omits this parameter sees no change in where those two reports land.
- **elicitation_depth** (optional, default: `standard`): Depth of requirements elicitation: `quick` (5 questions), `standard` (10 questions, default), or `deep` (15 questions). Engineer can also say "skip elicitation" to bypass Phase 1 entirely.

**Constraints for parameter acquisition:**

- You MUST have `topic` before proceeding. If not provided, ask once and wait.
- You MUST NOT ask for `output_path`, `validation_output_dir`, or `elicitation_depth`. Use defaults and proceed.
- If the engineer says "skip elicitation" or "I have clear requirements", You MUST skip Phase 1 and proceed directly to Phase 2.

## Steps

### Phase 1: Requirements Elicitation

Use the `socratic-elicitation` skill (Mode A: Intake) to conduct Socratic requirements elicitation before drafting anything.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST conduct this phase by running the `socratic-elicitation` skill (Mode A: Intake) directly. The skill's execution constitutes this phase's work; it is not a prerequisite that runs before it.
- You MUST ask questions sequentially, one at a time, waiting for the engineer's answer before asking the next, drawing from the skill's question dimensions: business value (`[PM]`), technical feasibility and dependencies (`[SDE]`), timeline and cross-team coordination (`[TPM]`), auth and data protection (`[Security]`), and observability and failure modes (`[Ops]`). Let each answer determine whether to follow up or move to the next dimension, rather than working through a fixed script.
- You MUST ask at most `elicitation_depth` questions total (5 / 10 / 15 per setting).
- You MUST NOT ask about dimensions already clearly addressed in the topic description.
- You MUST NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the skill has produced its Requirements Summary (per its Output section) and the engineer has confirmed it, or an early-exit signal ("enough" / "proceed" / etc.) was given.
- You MUST skip this phase entirely if the engineer said "skip elicitation" or "I have clear requirements".

**Expected Output:** The `socratic-elicitation` skill's Requirements Summary (Functional Requirements, Constraints, Non-Functional Requirements, Open Items) from the elicitation session. Present it before proceeding to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Draft Generation

Generate the design document using the outside-in structure mandated by `design-doc-guidelines`.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST apply the `design-doc-guidelines` skill before drafting.
- You MUST follow the outside-in structure: Problem → Requirements → Solution Overview → How It Works → Implementation Details → Implementation Plan.
- You MUST generate a Mermaid diagram before writing prose for each major section that describes a multi-component interaction, data flow, or sequence of steps (e.g. Solution Overview, How It Works). Every "How It Works" subsection MUST open with a diagram, with no exception, since `design-doc-guidelines`' checklist gates on it unconditionally. Elsewhere, You MAY skip a diagram for a section with no such structure to depict (e.g. a section in Implementation Details listing configuration values or a single API contract); state explicitly when a section has no diagram and why.
- You MUST run the `adr-generator` skill and generate an inline ADR for every significant design decision. The `adr-generator` skill applies the `decision-writing` ADR format: Context, Decision, Alternatives Considered (table), Consequences. Trade-off scores are added in Phase 3. Do NOT wait for them here.
- You MUST run the `design-doc-guidelines` checklist as a maker-checker pass after completing the draft.
- You MUST NOT advance to Phase 3 until the maker-checker pass produces zero CRITICAL findings.
- If the maker-checker pass finds CRITICAL issues, You MUST fix them and re-run before proceeding.

**Expected Output:** Complete draft design document at `output_path` with Mermaid diagrams for each multi-component/flow section, inline ADRs, and a passing `design-doc-guidelines` maker-checker result.

### Phase 3: Quality Gates

Run automated quality gates against the draft. This phase requires no user interaction.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST run the `doc-accuracy-analyzer` skill to verify all technical claims against the codebase. Flag any INCORRECT or UNVERIFIED findings in the draft with inline `> ⚠️` callouts.
- You MUST NOT block doc creation on UNVERIFIED claims. Mark them and proceed.
- You MUST run the `aws-service-validator` skill against all AWS service and feature claims in the draft. For each claim, call `aws___search_documentation` and `aws___read_documentation` (aws-mcp) to confirm or deny the assertion; call `aws___get_regional_availability` for any regional availability claim. Classify each claim as CONFIRMED, UNVERIFIED, or INCORRECT. Flag INCORRECT claims with `> ⚠️ INCORRECT: <correction>` callouts and UNVERIFIED claims with `> ⚠️ UNVERIFIED: <what was searched>` callouts. Write the full validation report to `validation_output_dir/<name>-aws-validation.md`.
- You MUST NOT block doc creation on UNVERIFIED AWS claims. Mark them and proceed.
- You MUST run the `trade-off-evaluator` skill for every significant design decision that has multiple options. Score each option 1-5 across cost, latency, complexity, scalability, and operability. Embed the scored table in the relevant ADR's Alternatives section and write the full trade-off report to `validation_output_dir/<name>-tradeoffs.md`.
- You MUST run the `adr-generator` skill to verify every Phase 2 ADR is embedded under the `## Architecture Decision Records` section. Do NOT regenerate ADRs already created in Phase 2. Enrich them only (the `trade-off-evaluator` bullet above owns score embedding).
- You MUST NOT ask the engineer for input during this phase.

**Expected Output:** Draft updated with `doc-accuracy-analyzer` and `aws-service-validator` findings inline. Trade-off matrices embedded in ADRs. Validation and trade-off reports written to `validation_output_dir`. Report: N AWS claims checked (N confirmed, N unverified, N incorrect), N trade-off matrices produced, N ADRs generated.

### Phase 4: Adversarial Review Loop

Challenge every major design decision before presenting the doc to the engineer.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST apply the `adversarial-design-review` skill to challenge every major architectural decision, trade-off, and AWS service choice, classifying each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or MINOR.
- You MUST run up to 5 adversarial rounds.
- After round 2: if any finding is classified CRITICAL (architectural), You MUST stop the loop immediately, present the finding to the engineer, and ask whether to redesign or override.
- You MUST apply corrections from each round and re-run the `design-doc-guidelines` maker-checker before the next round.
- You MUST exit the loop early when: 0 CRITICAL findings, 0 IMPORTANT findings, and fewer than 3 MINOR findings.
- If the exit condition is not met after 5 rounds, You MUST present the remaining issues to the engineer for manual resolution before proceeding to Phase 5.
- You MUST NOT silently discard findings. Every finding must either be fixed or explicitly noted as "engineer override".

**Expected Output:** Adversarial review summary: rounds run, findings by severity, corrections applied, remaining open issues (if any).

### Phase 5: Final Output

Produce the final artifact and present it to the engineer.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST apply all corrections from Phases 3 and 4 before writing the final file.
- You MUST run the `design-evaluation` skill to compute a confidence score: average of the 10 design-evaluation dimension scores (1-5 each). A section scoring below 3 MUST be flagged for revision.
- You MUST write the final document to `output_path`.
- You MUST present to the engineer: the output path, the confidence score (overall average + any sections below 3), and a one-line summary of any remaining open issues from Phase 4.
- You MUST NOT present the full document inline. Reference the file path.

**Expected Output:** Final `design-doc.md` at `output_path`. Confidence score reported. Engineer informed of any remaining issues requiring manual attention before principal engineer review submission.

## Quality Gate

The document is ready for principal engineer review when all of the following are true:

- `design-doc-guidelines` maker-checker: **0 CRITICAL findings**
- `doc-accuracy-analyzer`: **0 INCORRECT findings** (UNVERIFIED is acceptable with callouts)
- Adversarial review: **0 CRITICAL, 0 IMPORTANT, fewer than 3 MINOR findings**
- `design-evaluation` confidence score: **≥ 3.0 average** across all sections

If any condition is not met, the SOP MUST NOT present the doc as ready for principal engineer review. Present remaining issues to the engineer and ask: "Fix these before submission? [y/n]"
