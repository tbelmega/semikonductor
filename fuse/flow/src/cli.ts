  fuse-flow continue <slug> --blocked <why>
                                                the agent cannot finish the current step, for example
                                                after its agent gate's max_rounds; the owner decides
  fuse-flow continue <slug> --owner-approved [--note <text>]
                                                the owner approved the current step, which awaited the
                                                owner or was blocked; record it and print the next step
  fuse-flow continue <slug> --more-rounds <n> [--note <text>]
                                                the owner grants a blocked step's agent gates n more
                                                review rounds; the step is pending again
  fuse-flow continue <slug> --back-to <step> [--note <text>]
                                                the owner sends the work back from a step that awaits
                                                the owner or is blocked to <step> (it or an earlier one),
