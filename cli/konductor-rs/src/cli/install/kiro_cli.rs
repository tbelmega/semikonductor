// install/kiro_cli.rs — `InstallStrategy` for the Kiro CLI runtime.
//
// ── Scope (tasks 3.2, 3.4) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Detection + strategy selection is task 3.2's deliverable (`matches()`
// below); copying synthed Kiro CLI agent, skill, and context files from
// a local synth output tree (`<repo_root>/dist/<harness>/agents/*.json`,
// `<repo_root>/dist/<harness>/skills/<name>/**`,
// `<repo_root>/dist/<harness>/context/*`, `--from <repo-root>`) into
// this target's project-local `<target_dir>/` is task 3.4's
// (`install_from_local()`). SOPs are staged under `dist/<harness>/sops/`
// by synth but have no Kiro CLI install destination -- deliberately not
// copied. Each installed file's real content is hashed with SHA-256,
// and `.konductor/manifest` records the destination and per-file
// hashes. Without `--from`, remote (GitHub Release) installation is
// not yet implemented -- `install_from_local` fails with a clear
// message rather than silently succeeding.
//
// ── Two install roots ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Agents and context land under `<target_dir>/.kiro/` as before. Skills
// land under `<target_dir>/.konductor/skills/`, NOT `.kiro/skills/`:
// Kiro CLI's native skill discovery scans `.kiro/skills/`
// unconditionally and makes every skill visible to every agent
// regardless of what it declares, which defeats per-agent scoping.
// Moving skills outside that scanned directory means a skill is only
// visible to an agent that explicitly references it via a `skill://`
// resource entry -- confirmed live against kiro-cli-v2 2.18.0 (see
// ws-konductor-cli-notes.SKILL.md). `manifest.destination` reflects this
// by rooting at `target_dir` itself (see manifest.rs's module
// docstring); each `files[].path` carries its own `.kiro/` or
// `.konductor/` prefix.
//
// Exception: when the synth output carries no agents, skills land under
// `.kiro/skills/` instead. With no agent there is no scoping to protect
// and no agent to carry the skill-lookup MCP configuration, so
// `.kiro/skills/` is the only place a plain Kiro session can find them
// (see `plan::skills_destination_root`).
//
// Skill install MERGES into the skills directory: a skill directory this
// install did not emit (e.g. hand-authored) is left untouched, but a
// skill directory it does own is fully replaced so a file removed from
// the source doesn't linger in the destination.
//
// No checksum verification is performed against a locally-synthed tree:
// there is no published release checksum for output that was just
// built on this machine, so `artifact.rs`'s `verify_sha256` (which
// exists for a future real GitHub Release fetch) is not used here.
// This is intentional, not an oversight -- verifying a local build
// against a hash it cannot have is not meaningful.
//
// ── Module split ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This file's own logic is split three ways under `kiro_cli/`, purely
// for readability -- no behavior differs from before the split:
//   - `kiro_cli/plan.rs`   -- write-ahead planning (`plan_all_files` and
//     friends): what a run WOULD write, before anything is copied.
//   - `kiro_cli/copy.rs`   -- copy/install execution: what actually reads
//     from the synth tree and writes to `target_dir`.
//   - `kiro_cli/fs_util.rs` -- small filesystem primitives shared by both
//     (`is_executable`, `set_executable`, `reject_unsafe_file_name`).
// This file itself keeps only the `InstallStrategy` impl and re-exports
// everything sibling `install` modules (`claude`, `mcp_server`) and this
// file's own tests already depended on, so none of their call sites
// changed.
