// install/manifest.rs — `.konductor/manifest` read/write (Rust
// implementation).
//
// ── Scope (task 3.3) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Tracks installed files and their hashes (modeled on cli/gate-config/'s
// existing schema conventions -- a `schema_version`
// discriminator plus the minimal field set the task requires). Named
// `.konductor/manifest` (no `.json` suffix), used consistently across
// all references to this file.
//
// ── `files[].path` meaning ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// `destination` is the install ROOT, relative to `target_dir` (always
// `.` -- installs now span two roots under `target_dir`: `.kiro/` for
// agents and context, `.konductor/` for skills, per-agent scoping's
// requirement that skills live outside `.kiro/skills/`, which Kiro's
// native discovery scans unconditionally). Each `files[].path` is that
// installed file's path relative to `destination`, carrying its own
// content-type prefix, e.g. `.kiro/agents/k-example.json` or
// `.konductor/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` -- so the file's real on-disk
// location is `<target_dir>/<files[i].path>` (destination is `.`, so it
// contributes no additional path segment).
//
// ── Where `target_dir` itself is recorded ─────────────────────────────────
// No field stores `target_dir`'s absolute path. The manifest already
// lives at `<target_dir>/.konductor/manifest`, so `target_dir` is
// exactly the manifest file's own grandparent directory -- a future
// `update`/`uninstall` locates the tree it owns by finding the manifest
// (e.g. `$HOME/.konductor/manifest` or `<--target dir>/.konductor/manifest`),
// never by reading a path field out of it. This avoids baking a
// machine-specific absolute path into the document (which would make a
// fixture produced on one machine fail to match on another) while still
// making the destination unambiguous: a manifest's location on disk IS
// its target_dir, by construction, not by convention that could drift.
//
// ── Deterministic bytes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `files` is sorted by `path` before serialization so byte output is
// deterministic regardless of install order. JSON is rendered via
// `serde_json::to_string_pretty` (2-space indent, default separators),
// with a trailing newline appended.
//
// ── Write-ahead status (defect 1: orphaned files with no manifest) ───────
// Install used to copy every file THEN write the manifest last, so a
// crash/failure at the final step left every copied file on disk with NO
// manifest at all -- invisible and unremovable by a future `uninstall`.
// `status` closes this: the manifest is now written ONCE up front, before
// any file is copied, as `Status::InProgress` naming every path this
// install intends to touch, then rewritten as `Status::Complete` (with
// real hashes) only after every file has actually been copied. A crash in
// between always leaves a manifest naming exactly what may be on disk --
// the orphans become recoverable instead of invisible.
//
// `ManifestFile.sha256` is therefore `Option<String>`: the pre-copy
// record cannot know a file's real hash before it exists (and, for agent
// JSON, the hash depends on the install root -- `skill://`/`file://`
// entries are rewritten to absolute paths as part of the copy, so the
// bytes on disk differ per install target). Represented as an explicit
// JSON `null`, not an omitted key -- an omitted key would make
// `serde_json`'s default-derive behavior and `json.dumps`'s
// key-presence semantics two more places the two languages could drift
// out of byte-identical lockstep; an explicit `null` is unambiguous and
// identical to serialize in both.
//
// ── Per-file provenance (defect 2: hash-mismatching manifest after a
// failed re-install) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Before writing pre-copy record - Not just after a failed re-install:
// EVERY file this install is about to touch is classified into exactly
// one of three states below, determined by stat-ing the destination and
// consulting any prior manifest -- BEFORE that file is copied, so the
// classification can go in the write-ahead (`InProgress`) record too. A
// failed re-install with the OLD code left the previous manifest
// byte-identical while disk had already changed (one real file
// hash-mismatched in a measured run); the new pre-copy write means every
// re-install (failed or not) starts by overwriting the prior manifest
// with a fresh, current record naming what disk is ABOUT to become, so
// there is never a stale manifest sitting next to changed disk content.
//
// This provenance is also the future data an `uninstall` needs to be
// safe: it must delete only `Created`/`ReplacedOurs` paths (this install
// owns them), and must NEVER delete a `ReplacedForeign` path (pre-existing
// user content this install happened to overwrite) -- restoring the
// clobbered content is explicitly out of scope; this only records enough
// to make the deletion decision safely, not to undo the overwrite.
//
// ── `source` (doctor's manifest-based resolution) ─────────────────────
// Records the absolute, canonicalized `--from <repo-root>` path this
// install run was given (`None` if the caller has none to record).
// `konductor doctor`'s `check_source`/`check_config` resolve against
// this field by default, instead of `--from`/cwd -- see doctor.rs's
// module docstring for the full precedence rule. `#[serde(default)]`
// on read, so a manifest written before this field existed still
// deserializes (`source: None`), same back-compat pattern as
// `status`/`provenance` above.
