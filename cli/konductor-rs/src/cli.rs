// cli.rs — Konductor CLI command surface (Rust / clap implementation).
//
// There is no separate hand-authored spec file. This file defines the
// command surface directly via clap derive macros. The hidden
// `__dump_schema` command (see cli/schema.rs) exposes the live command
// tree as JSON so external tooling can validate the surface structurally
// rather than re-declaring it by hand. If you change the command
// surface, update this file (and any consumer of the schema dump).
//
// `init` and `config get/set/list` have real behavior (see cli/config.rs
// and cli/init.rs) -- `init` scaffolds `.konductor/` and writes a starter
// config.yml; `config get/set/list` read/report the effective merged
// configuration. `install`, `synth`, `update`, `uninstall`, and `doctor`
// also have real behavior (see cli/install.rs, cli/synth/mod.rs,
// cli/update.rs, cli/uninstall.rs, cli/doctor.rs) -- `doctor` inspects an
// install/checkout for problems via the same functions those commands
// already use, reporting a per-check ok/info/failed/stale status with
// remediation guidance. The remaining command (metrics) is a STUB at
// this milestone: it parses correctly and prints a "not yet
// implemented" message, then exits 0. No real business logic, no
// network calls, no filesystem mutation for it.
//
// ── Exit-code contract (Engineering Design §6) ─────────────────────────────
//   0 = all passed        1 = halted        2 = unresolved CRITICAL gate
//   3 = budget exceeded    4 = user aborted a paused verdict
//
// ── Usage-error remap (PITFALL) ────────────────────────────────────────────
// clap defaults CLI usage errors (bad flag, unknown subcommand, missing
// required arg) to exit code 2. That collides with this contract's
// "unresolved CRITICAL gate" signal. We intercept parse failures via
// `Cli::try_parse()` and exit with `EX_USAGE` (64, BSD sysexits.h) instead,
// so a malformed invocation is never mistaken for a gate failure. `--help`
// and `--version` (clap's own "DisplayHelp"/"DisplayVersion" outcomes) are
// NOT usage errors and keep clap's normal exit-0 behavior.
