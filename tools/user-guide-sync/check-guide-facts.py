"""Deterministic drift checker: docs/user-guide vs the Konductor source tree.

Verifies the *mechanical* facts the guide states — roster counts, catalog
coverage, config keys, the CLI command surface, internal links — against
their sources of truth. It deliberately does NOT judge prose, workflow
descriptions, or output samples; that is the semantic pass driven by
update-user-guide.prompt.md in this directory.

End-state rule: the guide describes finished behaviour even where the CLI is
stubbed, so this script never checks *whether* a feature is implemented —
only that names, counts, and surfaces agree with what the source declares.

Standard library only, with one exception: the section that parses the published
bundle's inline JavaScript shells out to ``node --check``, because nothing in the
standard library can tell whether the page will actually boot. Node missing is
reported as a failure, not skipped — a gate that passes when its checker is
absent is how a blank-rendering bundle shipped once already.

Exit codes: 0 = no drift found, 1 = drift found, 64 = could not run
(unexpected repo layout).

Usage:  python3 tools/user-guide-sync/check-guide-facts.py [--repo <path>]
