# Konductor

| **[🚧 Feature request](https://github.com/aws-solutions/konductor/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md)** | **[🐛 Bug Report](https://github.com/aws-solutions/konductor/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md)** |

Konductor is an open-source package of skills, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and workflows that automate the software development lifecycle (SDLC). A single agent session in Kiro CLI or Claude Code runs a workflow one step at a time and loads the skill each step names, so a request can move from requirements through design, specs, implementation, code review, testing and documentation with the same quality gates at every step.

> **Note:** Konductor used to ship agent specs: eight specialists and three orchestrators that routed work between them. They were removed, together with the skills and the SOP that only routed work to subagents; see [docs/research/2026-09-26-orchestration-skills-and-sops.md](docs/research/2026-09-26-orchestration-skills-and-sops.md). The user guide, which described the agents and the removed `konductor` command line tool, is not on this branch. The integration guides under [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/) still describe the agent-based layout and have not been rewritten yet. To install, use [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

The package ships as static configuration compatible with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download). No runtime infrastructure is required beyond the AI runtime itself.

## Why Konductor

Most AI coding sessions improvise their process. Konductor gives the session a written one: skills that say how to write requirements, design a system, review a design, split features, write specs, implement, review code, plan tests and document, each with its own checker, and workflows that run those skills in order with gates where the owner signs off.

You get this by installing one package. No servers to run and no infrastructure to provision: the skills, SOPs and workflows are files that your existing Kiro or Claude Code runtime reads directly.

## Quick Start

### Installing

Clone the `fuse` branch and run `install.sh`, into one project or for yourself across projects:

```bash
git clone -b fuse https://github.com/aws-solutions/konductor.git fuse-konductor
cd fuse-konductor
./install.sh --project /path/to/your/project
./install.sh --global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) covers every supported harness, update, uninstall and customer forks.

### First run

**Full SDLC pass with fuse-flow.** The workflow runner lives in this repository under [`fuse/flow/`](fuse/flow/README.md) and needs [Bun](https://bun.sh) or Node 22.18+, 23.6+ or 24+ with npm; it installs its own dependencies on first use. `install.sh` does not copy it, so run it from your checkout:

```bash
cd <your-project>
<konductor-checkout>/fuse/flow/fuse-flow start my-feature --workflow _k-full-sdlc
```

Then, in a Kiro CLI or Claude Code session in that project, ask:

```text
Run `<konductor-checkout>/fuse/flow/fuse-flow start my-feature` and do what it says. When a step is
done, run `continue`, which prints the next step. Repeat until the workflow is complete. Stop at
each owner gate and show me the artifact.
```

Each step names its skill and the artifact it must produce under `.konductor/`. `fuse-flow continue` refuses a step until its artifacts exist, and a gated step waits until you approve it with `fuse-flow continue my-feature --owner-approved`. fuse-flow finds skills in every directory `install.sh` writes to, so it needs no extra setup; [`fuse/flow/README.md`](fuse/flow/README.md) lists them.

---

## Workflows

The workflow definitions in [`fuse/flow/workflows/`](fuse/flow/workflows/) are the entry points for multi-phase work.

| Workflow                   | Steps                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_k-full-sdlc.yml`         | Elicitation, codebase analysis, requirements, design, design review, feature splitting, specs, implementation, code review, testing, documentation and a final summary, with owner gates between phases. |
| `_k-phase-chain.yml`       | The lighter chain: requirements, design, feature splitting, specs, implementation, code review and QA, with no owner gates.                                                |
| `custom-example-*.yml`     | Examples of project-specific workflows at different sizes.                                                                                                                 |

For a single task, ask the session to use a skill directly; see [Usage Examples](#usage-examples).

You can edit these workflows or add your own in the same folder. Personal workflows that you do not want to share go in `fuse/flow/workflows/personal/`, which is gitignored. To share workflows with a group but not with everybody, keep them in a separate repository and add a symlink to it named `fuse/flow/workflows/team`, which is gitignored too. fuse-flow finds a workflow by name in either folder; [`fuse/flow/README.md`](fuse/flow/README.md) gives the lookup order.

## Skills

Skills are modular knowledge packages that a session loads when a task needs them. On Claude Code, installed skills live in `.claude/skills/`: only their names and descriptions are in context at session start, and the full content loads when a skill is invoked. On Kiro CLI, skills are installed to `.kiro/skills/`, where Kiro CLI's native skill discovery finds them. (A package that ships agent specs installs its skills under `.konductor/skills/` instead, so that each agent sees only the skills it declares; this package ships none.) The package ships **78 skills** across 8 capability areas:

| Category                          | Count | Representative skills                                                                                                                       | Covers                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Persistent Memory

Sessions that load the `persistent-memory` skill (see the Orchestration & Delegation row in [Skills](#skills) above) keep a small local scratchpad across sessions. It needs `bash` and [Bun](https://bun.sh), and no other setup: the skill creates the directory on first write and appends it to `.gitignore` itself.

Two files, split by what they hold:

| File                          | Holds                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `.konductor/memory/MEMORY.md` | Project, codebase, and environment facts |
| `.konductor/memory/USER.md`   | Personal preferences and working style   |

An optional `.konductor/memory-config.json` lets you tune two things: the per-file character limits and a URL allowlist restricting which external domains can appear in an entry. Copy the template to get started:

```bash
mkdir -p .konductor && cp skills/persistent-memory/memory-config.json.template .konductor/memory-config.json
```

Every write is checked by a validator script — an entry that exceeds a limit or fails the allowlist is rejected and reported back to you, never silently dropped.

## SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

The SOPs below live in `agent-sops/`. The installer does not install them; they are being replaced by fuse-flow workflows.

| SOP                                  | What it does                                                                                                                                      |

## Usage Examples

**Review a diff before opening a PR:**

```bash
claude
> Use the code-review skill to review my current branch against main.
```

**Targeted request that uses one skill:**

```bash
claude -p "Use the threat-modeling skill to create a threat model for a public REST API backed by DynamoDB."
```

**Run the full SDLC workflow:** start the `_k-full-sdlc` workflow with fuse-flow as described in [First run](#first-run), then let the session follow the steps `fuse-flow start` and `continue` print. It runs every phase, requirements through documentation, and writes its artifacts under `.konductor/`.

The same prompts work in Kiro CLI, Codex, Cursor and OpenCode sessions.

## Optional Integrations

Konductor registers none of these MCP servers for you. Register each one you need in your harness's own MCP configuration.

## Data Collection

fuse-konductor collects no data. The installer sends nothing over the network. fuse-flow downloads its two dependencies, zod and yaml, from the npm registry when they are missing from `fuse/flow/node_modules` in your clone, normally only the first time it runs; otherwise it sends nothing. Offline, that run fails and names the install command to run.
