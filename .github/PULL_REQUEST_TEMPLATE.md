## Description

<!--
Use bullet points grouped by category. Each item should state WHAT changed and WHY (rationale).
Avoid prose paragraphs — reviewers scan, not read.

Example format:
**Skills:**
- Added `skills/foo/` — provides X capability needed for Y workflow
- Removed `skills/bar/` — superseded by `skills/baz/`, which covers the same case more simply

**SOPs / Workflows:**
- `k-plan`: added a dependency check step — catches cycles before estimation
- `fuse/flow/workflows/_k-phase-chain.yml`: renamed skill reference `bar` → `baz` — avoids a naming collision

**CLI / Docs / Other:**
- Updated `README.md` — documents the new install option
- Added `docs/guides/foo-integration.md` — walkthrough for the new opt-in integration
