# test-nonbullet-injection.sh — Regression test for the CWE-20 input
# validation gap fixed in memory-validator.sh's validation loop.
#
# Background: memory-validator.sh's content checks (near-duplicate,
# 500-char cap, URL allowlist, code-block ban, instruction-like-language
# detection) previously ran only against lines matching a bullet gate
# (`[[ "$line" =~ ^[[:space:]]*[-*] ]] || continue`). Any line NOT starting
# with "-" or "*" -- a markdown heading, a plain paragraph, a blockquote, or
# a numbered-list item -- skipped every check below that gate and was still
# written to disk verbatim via $PROPOSED. Since future agent sessions
# auto-load these memory files, an injection payload only needed to avoid
# the "- "/"* " prefix to bypass all enforcement.
#
# This test feeds four non-bullet-formatted injection payloads (one per
# markdown construct named in the finding) plus one well-formed bullet
# entry that must still pass, and asserts each outcome against a real
# invocation of memory-validator.sh. It is self-contained: no repo state,
# network access, or prior setup is required.
#
# Usage: bash test-nonbullet-injection.sh
# Exit code: 0 = all assertions passed, 1 = a regression was detected.

# --- Scenario 1: heading carrying instruction-like language -------------
# CWE-20: a heading line ("## ...") bypassed the bullet gate entirely, so
# "ignore all previous instructions"-style payloads were never checked.
# Payload is deliberately just the ignore+instructions combo -- adding
# "act as admin" would trip the earlier "act as" phrase check first (see
# memory-validator.sh's phrase-check loop, which runs before the
# keyword+agent-word combo check) and this scenario would no longer
# isolate the combo check it's meant to exercise.

# --- Fix-back cycle 1: derive_entry() bullet-strip anchoring -------------
# Same attack class as above ("payload dressed as markdown"), residual
# bypass found on re-review of the first CWE-20 fix. derive_entry()'s
# bullet branch reused the original "${line#*[-*] }" bash expansion, which
# removes the SHORTEST matching prefix ANYWHERE in the line -- i.e. up to
# the first occurrence of a "-"/"*" immediately followed by a space -- not
# necessarily the leading bullet marker. The numbered-item branch already
# used an anchored `sed -E 's/^[[:space:]]*[0-9]+\.[[:space:]]*//'`; the
# bullet branch has been changed to mirror it:
# `sed -E 's/^[[:space:]]*[-*][[:space:]]*//'`.
#
# Scenario 5 and 6 below are the exact two reproduction lines supplied by
# the reviewer. Empirically (verified against an isolated copy of the
# pre-tightening derive_entry()), these two specific lines are already
# REJECTED by the *pre-fix* code too: the leading "- " marker is
# immediately followed by a single space, so bash's shortest-prefix match
# already lands at the very first character and happens to strip exactly
# the leading marker -- no truncation occurs for this exact string shape.
# They are kept here as required regression coverage (they must keep being
# rejected under the tightened fix) even though they do not, by themselves,
# demonstrate a truncate-then-bypass on this codebase.
#
# Scenario 7 is the differential case that DOES demonstrate the truncation
# bug and the fix for it: a bullet marker NOT immediately followed by a
# single space (`-1 ...`) delays the first "-"/"*"+space match found by the
# old shortest-prefix expansion until a LATER marker deep in the payload
# (here, the closing "*" of the emphasis wrapper), truncating the checked
# entry down to just the trailing "now" and letting the payload through
# while the full malicious line is still written to disk verbatim. Verified
# via isolated pre-fix vs. post-fix invocation: pre-fix ACCEPTS (rc=0,
# bypass), post-fix REJECTS (rc=1, "instruction-like language").
